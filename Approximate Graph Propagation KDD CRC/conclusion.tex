In this paper, we propose the concept of approximate graph propagation, which unifies various proximity measures, including transition probabilities, PageRank and Personalized PageRank, heat kernel PageRank, and Katz. We present a randomized graph propagation algorithm that achieves almost optimal computation time with a theoretical error guarantee. We conduct an extensive experimental study to demonstrate the effectiveness of AGP on real-world graphs. We show that AGP outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in the specific application of local clustering and node classification with GNNs. For future work, it is interesting to see if the AGP framework can inspire new proximity measures for graph learning and mining tasks.
